    <h1>Sajek Tour During Winter</h1>
    <h3>Author: Al Mahfuz </h3>
    <p>Sajek is located in the verdant hills of Kasalong range of mountains amidst the serene and exotic beauty of nature. Lofty mountains, dense forest, sprawling grasslands and miles of hilly tracks feature the valley. The simple and basic indigenous lifestyle of local people is just fabulous for visitors to spend a day.</p>
